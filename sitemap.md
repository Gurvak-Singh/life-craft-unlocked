* **Consistent Component:**  
  * Reuse the same footer component across all pages.

### **6\. Typography**

* **Spacing & Borders:**  
  * Uniform padding, margin, and border-radius across all cards.

### **9\. Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons**

**Requirement:**

* **Placement:**  
  * CTAs should appear in the same location relative to their context (e.g., bottom center of a section).  
* **Style:**

* **Behavior:**  
  * Link behavior and hover states should be identical across all CTAs.
